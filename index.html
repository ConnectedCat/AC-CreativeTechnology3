            <h2>/*<br />Project 1: <br />Techno-kludging<br />*/</h2>
            <div class="project-brief">
                <p>Do you have a technology-dependent creative project in your head that you want to build? Do you look at a particular kind of work by other interactive designers/artists and think "I wish I knew how to make that!" In this project, we're dropping you in at the deep end. We want you to propose a creative technology project, and we're going to try to help you build it. Or, more accurately, we're going to help you identify and kludge together a small critical piece of it. The question of scope – figuring out what that "small critical piece" is – is fundamental here, and will underlie many of our discussions as your projects progress.</p>
                <p>To "kludge" is to use an ill-assorted collection of parts to make something. It typically has negative connotations, suggesting something that has been quickly and shoddily put together. But kludging can be a valuable part of an iterative, exploratory, creative design process as we move back and forth between thinking and making, concept and prototype. This is especially true when working with (and designing) interactive technologies, where we are concerned with dynamic experiences and behaviors.</p>
                <p><strong>Tips for a productive project</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Don't spend time trying to think of a completely novel idea before you start. In this project it's totally OK – we encourage it, even – to be motivated by the desire to replicate interactive and/or technological characteristics you have identified in others' work.</li>
                    <li>The project might turn out not the way you envisioned it.</li>
                    <li>Although we hope to learn some practical things, we are equally interested in the process of thinking through making.</li>
                    <li>Physical computing might be too much of a challenge in this short intro project, unless you already have components or can get them asap.</li>
                </ul>

                    <li> - Choose a technological artifact – a consumer product, an interactive artwork, a piece of software, an installation, anything – which exhibits some characteristics of a 'creative tech' interest of yours. (Choose more than one if you are torn between multiple interests!) Find an image of your artifact and drop it in the Slack channel.</li>
                    <li> - Consider: how was this artifact created? What are the parts and the components? How can they be categorized, grouped? How do they connect to each other in a system? What are some of the tools and resources used to create those parts and bring them together? Be prepared to share your thoughts when we next meet.</li>

                <h5>Homework:</h5>
                <p>Make a system diagram of your chosen artifact. (You can continue with what you already have, or choose something new.) Your diagram should communicate the types of connection and configuration of key components of your artifact. But (!) we want you to go above and beyond this strict engineering definition of a system diagram. As designers we are interestested in tangibility, materiality, experience, aesthetic, emotion, cultural context, social connections... What are other qualities you could foreground and integrate into the diagram?</p>
                <p>Consider: If you were to build one specific technological part of this artifact, what would that be? This question is an entirely subjective one, and refers to your own aspirations as a maker. We strongly encourage you not to get too caught up in conceptual interests at this point. Is there an interaction, behavior, or function you would like to emulate, or a technological effect you are yearning to achieve? What tools do you think you would use? What skills would you need?</p>
                <p>Prepare to come to the next class with the homework on 2-3 slides which we can add to a shared deck at the start of the meeting.</p>

            <h2>/*<br />Project 2:<br />Environmental simulation<br />*/</h2>
            <div class="project-brief">
                <p>
                    Simulations are generated by models that mimic alternate conditions.
                    Before the digital era, simulations were mostly associated with
                    non-design fields, such as engineering, epidemiology, astronomy,
                    meteorology, psychology, and economics. These models were typically
                    used to predict or infer performance or events in possible, or
                    future, or otherwise unknowable states. When software-enabled
                    simulation eventually emerged, it evolved rapidly in non-research
                    domains such as gaming and visual effects for cinema, with echoes in
                    the art world from the very beginning. From there, crossovers
                    continued into architecture and countless media applications. Today,
                    sophisticated simulations are ubiquitous: in VR, AR, games, movies,
                    GUIs (not to mention the simulations of disasters - like pandemics,
                    fires, and hurricanes - we consume daily through the media.) AR, VR,
                    gaming, and animation all employ tools that could be classified as
                    simulations of one type or another, and in this workshop will be
                    experimenting with these fundamentals using a game engine to apply
                    behaviors and conditions into a digital environment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Alongside this technical exposure, however, we will consider - in
                    our projects and conversation - the influence of tools for
                    simulation on design and art. Unlike simulation, representation has
                    long been the realm of the designer: illustrating the world for the
                    purposes of communication or as a form of instrumentalized
                    image-making for developing texts, media, objects, and places to be
                    produced. Is this significant? Is it merely a distinction without a
                    difference? How can the designer/artist use simulation critically,
                    productively, originally? How does one shift their attention from
                    questions of form to questions of behavior and performance (or are
                    they the same thing)? When using tools developed for specific
                    industries (namely, gaming and visual effects) does one intervene to
                    have the results serve the values of the project, rather than the
                    default qualities of the expected use? Does the capability of
                    creating digital models capable of self-generating and simulating
                    outcomes alter one’s perceptions as a maker in general?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Climatological, social, and technological changes are occurring
                    increasingly at a global, rather than regional, scale. While
                    addressing issues of this complexity has always required the
                    collaboration of multiple forms of scientific expertise, inexpensive
                    super-computation and accessible software allows designers to engage
                    with topics long considered strictly the purview of these scientific
                    researchers and engineers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For this project, you will create a vivarium: a micro-world where a
                    defined set of properties and behaviors are placed and developed.
                    You will be randomly assigned one of the following verbs, each based
                    on a current global crisis, nearing a tipping point: a condition
                    where a controlling system is overwhelmed, sometimes beyond
                    potential return or repair.
