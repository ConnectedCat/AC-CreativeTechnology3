        <h3>Project 1: Techno-kludging</h3>

        <p>Do you have a technology-dependent creative project in your head that you want to build? Do you look at a particular kind of work by other interactive designers/artists and think "I wish I made that!" (We hope you answer "yes" to one or both of these questions!)</p>
        <p>In this project, we're dropping you in at the deep end. We want you to propose a creative technology project, and we're going to try to help you build it. Or, more accurately, we're going to help you identify and kludge together a small critical piece of it.</p>
        <p>That's it, basically.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>the project might turn out not the way you envisioned it</li>
            <li>we'll use Slack to ask questions, coordinate individual and group meetings, share resources as we go along</li>
            <li>critical piece, critical prototype</li>
            <li>setting the scope of a project</li>
            <li>don't spend time trying to think of a completely novel idea before you start. in this project it's totally OK – we encourage it, even – to be motivated by the desire to replicate interactive and/or technological characteristics you have identified in others' work.</li>
            <li>although we hope to learn some practical things, we are equally interested in the process of thinking <em>through</em> making</li>
            <li>physical computing stuff might be too much of a challenge in this short intro project, unless you already have components or can get them asap</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Project 2: Environmental simulation</h3>
        <p>Simulations are generated by models that mimic alternate conditions. Before the digital era, simulations were mostly associated with non-design fields, such as engineering, epidemiology, astronomy, meteorology, psychology, and economics. These models were typically used to predict or infer performance or events in possible, or future, or otherwise unknowable states. When software-enabled simulation eventually emerged, it evolved rapidly in non-research domains such as gaming and visual effects for cinema, with echoes in the art world from the very beginning. From there, crossovers continued into architecture and countless media applications. Today, sophisticated simulations are ubiquitous: in VR, AR, games, movies, GUIs (not to mention the simulations of disasters - like pandemics, fires, and hurricanes - we consume daily through the media.) AR, VR, gaming, and animation all employ tools that could be classified as simulations of one type or another, and in this workshop will be experimenting with these fundamentals using a game engine to apply behaviors and conditions into a digital environment.</p>
        <p>Alongside this technical exposure, however, we will consider - in our projects and conversation - the influence of tools for simulation on design and art. Unlike simulation, representation has long been the realm of the designer: illustrating the world for the purposes of communication or as a form of instrumentalized image-making for developing texts, media, objects, and places to be produced. Is this significant? Is it merely a distinction without a difference? How can the designer/artist use simulation critically, productively, originally? How does one shift their attention from questions of form to questions of behavior and performance (or are they the same thing)? When using tools developed for specific industries (namely, gaming and visual effects) does one intervene to have the results serve the values of the project, rather than the default qualities of the expected use? Does the capability of creating digital models capable of self-generating and simulating outcomes alter one’s perceptions as a maker in general?</p>
        <p>Climatological, social, and technological changes are occurring increasingly at a global, rather than regional, scale. While addressing issues of this complexity has always required the collaboration of multiple forms of scientific expertise, inexpensive super-computation and accessible software allows designers to engage with topics long considered strictly the purview of these scientific researchers and engineers.</p>
        <p>For this project, you will create a vivarium: a micro-world where a defined set of properties and behaviors are placed and developed. You will be randomly assigned one of the following verbs, each based on a current global crisis, nearing a tipping point: a condition where a controlling system is overwhelmed, sometimes beyond potential return or repair.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Flooding (rising sea levels)</li>
            <li>Melting (dissolving glaciers)</li>
            <li>Blowing (powerful hurricanes)</li>
            <li>Burning (stronger wildfires)</li>

        <h3>Project 3: Synthetic relationships</h3>
        <p>Working with a partner create two electronic beings who are able to percieve some aspects of environment around them, communicate their findings and respond to the communications of their counterpart.</p>
        <p><strong>Things to consider:</strong> Are both creatures going to be in the same environment or in different ones? How will their sensory perceptions be processed internally? How will the result of this process be encoded for transmission? Is their communication going to be visible to the outsiders? Is it going to be one-way at a time or full duplex?</p>
        <p><strong>Documentation:</strong> write down your responses to the questions posed in the brief. Create a diagram outlining the communication schema and depicting all your decisions. Create a video explaning the inner workings of your system and showing it in action.</p>
