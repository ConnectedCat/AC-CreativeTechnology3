If this specific design is designed for a specific group of people then it probably falls into the category of tryborg. If the design is not intended for a specific group of people, when anyone could incorporate that in their life, then that seem to be a cyborg design.<br />10:29:48 From christie wu to Everyone:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; I saw people start selling &ldquo;Airtag Watch Bands&rdquo; on amazon, so they can use airbags to track their kidsðŸ˜‚ <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Compatible-Silicone-Protective-Lightweight-Children/dp/B095V1W67T/ref=pd_lpo_1?pd_rd_i=B095V1W67T&amp;psc=1" target="_blank" >https://www.amazon.com/Compatible-Silicone-Protective-Lightweight-Children/dp/B095V1W67T/ref=pd_lpo_1?pd_rd_i=B095V1W67T&amp;psc=1</a> <br />10:30:01 From christie wu to Everyone:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; *airtags<br />10:30:10 From Maxim Safiouline to Everyone:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ^ digital leash<br />10:32:24 From Alan Amaya to Everyone:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJg02ivYzSs&amp;ab_channel=KeiichiMatsuda" target="_blank" >https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJg02ivYzSs&amp;ab_channel=KeiichiMatsuda</a> <br />10:35:23 From Li Hongming to Everyone:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; http://www.gafsou.ch/hplus<br />10:37:59 From Ben Hooker to Everyone:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;The new devices do not aspire to visual complication or unconventional semantics beyond what their &ldquo; customizable &rdquo; interfaces allow&rdquo; (from Garments of Paradise)<br />10:40:40 From Lyu Guowei to Everyone:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Me too.<br />10:41:05 From Fanxuan Zhu to Everyone:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Don&rsquo;t have the money to be an early adopter&hellip;ðŸ˜…Knowing that they will improve in couple years&hellip;<br />10:41:39 From Lyu Guowei to Everyone:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Tech product depreciate quickly<br />10:42:31 From Yuwen Qianyue to Everyone:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; I actually doubt the ability of a bracelet or watch to detect calorie consumption, I always feel they are inaccurate.

And historically, technology in the 90s felt like it was ever expanding and might never be gated in any way, but now it seems somewhat like we live in an age where technology has collapsed into itself.<br />11:07:13 From Alan Amaya to Everyone:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; I think the iPod started that way too<br />11:07:59 From Ben Hooker to Everyone:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/9/17832124/ai-artificial-intelligence-supply-chain-anatomy-of-ai-kate-crawford-interview" target="_blank" >https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/9/17832124/ai-artificial-intelligence-supply-chain-anatomy-of-ai-kate-crawford-interview</a> <br />11:08:16 From Li Hongming to Everyone:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; You can't even replace your phone's battery yourself now<br />11:09:06 From Yue Xi to Everyone:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="https://foodtank.com/news/2021/01/farmers-fight-for-right-to-repair-their-own-equipment/" target="_blank" >https://foodtank.com/news/2021/01/farmers-fight-for-right-to-repair-their-own-equipment/</a> <br />11:10:00 From Ben Hooker to Everyone:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planned_obsolescence" target="_blank" >https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planned_obsolescence</a> <br />11:12:43 From Ben Hooker to Everyone:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocratic_Oath" target="_blank" >https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocratic_Oath</a> <br />11:14:15 From Maxim Safiouline to Everyone:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="https://muledesign.com/2017/07/a-designers-code-of-ethics" target="_blank" >https://muledesign.com/2017/07/a-designers-code-of-ethics</a> <br />11:15:29 From Santanilla Mario to Everyone:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; As the agency to produce through 3d printers&hellip; a thought 5-10 years ago<br />11:15:35 From Santanilla Mario to Everyone:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="https://jigsaw.google.com/" target="_blank" >https://jigsaw.google.com/</a> <br />11:16:00 From Yue Xi to Everyone:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; A modular phone designed to be repaired: <a href="https://www.fairphone.com/en/" target="_blank" >https://www.fairphone.com/en/</a> <br />11:21:54 From Santanilla Mario to Everyone:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Blockchain to give a contemporary example<br />11:24:23 From Maxim Safiouline to Everyone:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; It like the eco movement in the 70's : )<br />11:26:56 From Maxim Safiouline to Everyone:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; The future is already here, it's just not evenly distributed<br />11:28:23 From Eric Schubert to Everyone:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; If 9/11 didn&rsquo;t happen, we might not have felt the need to have a smartphone in the same way<br />11:31:26 From Eric Schubert to Everyone:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; And you can&rsquo;t do anything subversive with an &nbsp;iPhone app or it will be pulled from the App Store<br />11:33:27 From Yue Xi to Everyone:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; I would like to have a car with 5 wheels<br />11:33:48 From Maxim Safiouline to Everyone:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; the 5th one being the steering wheel?<br />11:34:21 From Li Hongming to Everyone:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; buy one cylinder once a month make my V12 car<br />11:34:44 From Maxim Safiouline to Everyone:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Seasonal add-ons for your car<br />11:34:51 From Maxim Safiouline to Everyone:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; car fashion<br />11:35:23 From Santanilla Mario to Everyone:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Tesla will/does charge you monthly to use some of the gadgets the car has<br />11:35:59 From Eric Schubert to Everyone:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; They&rsquo;ve become cyborgs<br />11:35:59 From Santanilla Mario to Everyone:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; They must be working on Unity<br />11:36:05 From Eric Schubert to Everyone:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ^^<br />11:37:17 From Lyu Guowei to Everyone:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Is there any future project about wearable?<br />11:39:03 From Maxim Safiouline to Everyone:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Maybe the one hiding in your head?</p>
